This project uses k-means clustering to test how it works, testing its accuracy for different datasets and number of clusters, vizualizing it, and using it to classify different types of flowers and digits. The first part deals with classifying digits, visualizing that data, and trying different numbers of clusters. The second part tries different inputs of k-means clustering to calassify flower types and digits and visualizing these clusters. 

This project can be run in any python enviroment. Some Python libraries may need to be installed via pip including: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, progress, and sklearn.
