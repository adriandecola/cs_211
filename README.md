Please note that instructor permission was given to upload these projects. 

This course was called Computing for Insight. We utilized Python libraries to fetch data online, scan directories, open and read files, parse HTML, display data of many forms, use machine learning to classify objects, and much more. I did not upload all of the projects because I had lost the data the projects originally had used. These projects can be run using any Python enviroment.
